    <h1 class="text-center">What is Cenorship?</h1>
    <p>Roughly speaking, censorship is an action of disapprovation and curtailment of some content provided as a message (artistic, journalistic, etc.) and possible removal of
       public circulation of this content, generally linked to the justification of protecting the interest of a group or individual.<br>

       And whats is your historical orign ?
       The history of censorship is long narrated and goes hand in hand with the history of civilization and freedom, in addition to being a periodic, cyclical history.<br>
       When talking about censorship, we must remember the influence of power, that is, it is necessary to understand that, throughout history, power (in most cases, the politician) is responsible for dictating censorship. Episodes of censorship occur at different times in history and with different ideological groups in power, generally typical of authoritarian or inquisitive groups.<br>
       So, as to the origin of censorship itself, we do not have a defined date, however, in fact, it is certain that, since the beginning of civilization, there was already the act of censorship, of restricting some freedom of expression.

    <p>
        The censorship of the radical right after the First World War was undoubtedly a response to the danger, indeed the reality, of social revolution and workers' power
        in general.<br>
        The way found to curb the advance of divergent ideas or even indoctrinate the population to accept a single political-economic system is through censorship,
        manipulation, control of what is worked in schools, what is seen in theaters, broadcast in radio and television and, simultaneously, to advertise in favor of the 
        current model.
        And it is in a dictatorial, totalitarian regime that this exacerbated control becomes possible.
        Brazil, as well as other republics in Latin America, such
        as Argentina and Chile, are examples of countries that have bowed to a political-economic and , because of that, they imposed totalitarian regimes in order to stop the 
       advance of contrary ideas, besides curbing the propagation of different ideologies. The military dictatorship in Brazil confirmed the alliance between that country and 
       the United States, prohibiting any manifestation of support or sympathy for the socialist regime, while in Cuba, allied with the Soviet Union, the attitude of repudiation
        of capitalism occurs with the same intensity. 
        It is in a context in which the threat of war is imminent and that totalitarian regimes are perpetuated in power that 1984 
       is written, and it becomes a detailed description of this type of political regime that accompanied several nations during the 20th century .<br>
   
       Other characteristics of this period are the espionage and counterespionage tactics used by the countries involved in order to censor, monitor and punish any transgression
       of the rules imposed by the system.
