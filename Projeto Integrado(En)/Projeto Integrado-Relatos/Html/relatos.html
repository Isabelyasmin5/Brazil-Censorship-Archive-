        <p class="indrocu">
           
            For the first time in history since redemocratization,
            Brazil has a president of the Republic that celebrates the military dictatorship in the country. Dictatorship that 
            leaves at least 434 dead, missing or tortured with techniques such as shocks and "pau de arara"(techinique for torture 
            using a big stick) , instituted censorship in the press and in art, drove people into exile, ousted politicians, increased
            social inequality and ended the freedom of expression.
            
            <br>
            And in order to never forget the horrors of the dictatorship, we edited and published seven reports of the victims that
            testified in the National Truth Commission. These are testimonies from students, teachers, military personnel, workers, 
            involved or not with the groups of the armed struggle that were formed mainly after the hardening of the coup, with 
            Institutional Act No. 5. The full testimony can be checked in the links at the end of each report.

                (university student)</strong></p>
            <p class="relato1 relatos">I had already decided to come to USP and continue studying, but my father said: “No.” And one day 
                I came to him and said: dad, I'm going. He said, "If you go, you'll never set foot in this house again." I took the 
                entrance exam at USP, I entered, but I went to CRUSP to live there as a clandestine person because there was no
                money, nor a condition to pay anything here, and I went. that was the end of the years  1967, 1968. I participated in 
                everything that happened either in the Student Movement or in that cultural thing, everything was impressive, like a 
                marvel and the happiness of having lived that moment. Until the end of the year when AI-5 is enacted in December,  the 
                Army surrounds the USP and, above all, the CRUSP, but the Army is something really impressive.
                <br>
                
                <br>
                The Army, the dressed soldiers, tanks, it was like a war operation, and inside you just had students. We woke up at 
                dawn, and they have already started to surround USP. I remember well, we went down five levels of stairs already dealing
                with truncheons and kicks for those who were awake, and the ones who were sleeping woke up dealing with the same thing,
                and we left the place only with the cloths we were wearing. And then we stayed there between almost to 11 am or noon . 
                I don't know. And then some vans arrived and we were taken to Tiradentes. Then they made us  a criminal report, and 
                then most of us were released. […]
                <br>
                 
                 <br>[…]At that time you didn't let yourself be trapped. There was no such chance, because the arrest was already too
                fierce. And when then I knew I was being wanted by the police , and they started going where I was going, they even went 
                to my house in the countryside. And then I had to start living the clandestine way, because there was no way of surrending 
                my self. But at that time my brother and my sister-in-law had already moved to ALN, and then finally I ended up also going
                to ALN, because the only support I had was my brother. I went throung 1969 having to hide and taking care of this front of
                mass, particularly the Student Movement.
                <br>

                <br>Until in January of 1970 I was arrested, because one of the groups I took care of and had contact, fell and with that
                I fall as well. It was early in the morning, it was around 9 am, and you're already fell like you got beaten up inside… At
                the time, the famous Veraneios, and you already gets beaten up in the car. A series of circumstances arise and I ask myself:
                What is this torture experience like?Who resists torture? If it resists, how much does it resists? I was on this Student 
                Movement front. Then this was not a priority for them, even though they were more interested in armed actions, it started 
                right away:"Let's go to your brother's house, where?" I do not know I do not know. I spent the whole day getting beat up in
                order to give them his address.
                <br>
               
                <br>
                It gave me a huge relief to tell them all: <strong>“You can hit me, you can, even kill or whatever, but I won't  give it to
                you because I don't know.” </strong>And that calmed me down enormously, several times I fainted on the stick [of the macaw], 
                and I think they were convincing themselves. We stayed at DOI-Codi for a while, but a fight broke out between DOPS and OBAN 
                to return it, because they want they had arrested the two of us [she and her sister-in-law], after a while we were returned 
                to DOPS, there was another stick for DOPS and it is on this tour that I met Dilma. I was trapped with her in the cell, until
                we were taken to Tiradentes. And at Tiradentes I stayed almost three years, I was arrested in January of 1970 and left at 
                the end of 1972.<a href="http://cnv.memoriasreveladas.gov.br/images/pdf/depoimentos/vitimas_civis/Leslie_Denise_Beloque.pdf">(In full)</a>

                I'm a peasant's daughter, my grandparents and my parents were peasants, everything that produced half was the boss's and the other
                half took out the expenses, and what was left was what we had to survive. I thought unfair, my dream was a piece of land to be ours.
                In October 1954, I married José Ribeiro da Silva, another dreamer. On November 9, 1954, we went to Formoso and Trombas in the litigious region of squatters, it was just bush, no road, no school, no health clinic, no pharmacy, only desert.
                I was a Communist Party member, my husband too, and we belonged to the District Series Committee, and then we were assigned to go there
                to help that region.                                                                                              
                <br>
                
                <br>
                That's when the coup of 1964 came, we knew we were going to be hunted. We followed everything on the radio, my husband arrived at
                our house at night in the Formoso forest and his bags were already packed. I had a baby  of eight months and had four legitimate 
                children and four adopted children, two of whom were special adoptives and a brother from my mother, who was also special. Ribeiro
                agreed to send our people to my uncle's house, until my mother and brother came from Brasília to take care of them. During the 
                day, I would go into the woods and at night he went to sleep in the hut. There was a person who brought me a plate of food at night.
                <strong>A position was] not to resist [the coup], we had no conditions. Who were we? we were going to resist with  garrucha?</strong>
                In the course, we decided to stay in our possession in a place of difficult access, but closer to my children and easier to help my 
                mother guide the farm.<br>

                <br>
                In April [1966], at the beginning of the month, <strong>we were surprised by the police in our hiding place.</strong> Ribeiro
                was very bad, dehydrated, they kicked, punched, cursed, we took a long time walking in the bushes  until we got to our ranch. 
                There everything was turned over, the police stole a promissory note for 500 thousand cruzeiros.<strong>They put us in the car
                with kicks, shoves and all kinds of bad words, two leagues later they stopped the cars at a road rendezvous. Then the horror 
                session begins.</strong>One group stayed a short distance away distance forcing me to look at them beating César and Ribeiro.
                I turned my face and they pulled my hair and forced me to look, they asked me about José Porfírio, Mário Borges and others, 
                I said I didn't know.  And they said that I was their lover and that I would rather see my husband and brother die than give 
                up my lovers.<br>

                <br>They put cigarette stubs in their hands until they had a blister, pinched their bodies with knifes. They they were all 
                injured. The faces were just bruises. <strong>They broke Ribeiro's nose with a punch, dragged him by his feet and hung upside
                down from a tree, blood running from their noses. If I didn't say what they wanted to listen, they would kill the hanged Ribeiro.
                </strong>That made me so desperate, but I didn't beg or cry, made me want to kill myself, but how? I went into ignorance, I 
                laughed and the policeman shouted: "This naughty bitch prefers seeing her husband dead rather than speak." And I said, "I don't
                know and if I knew I wouldn't talk either", and I slapped him in the face with all the strength I had, he staggered and then he
                punched me, one pf my ears became useless.<br>

                <br><strong> I fainted, when I woke up I was wet with pinga(alcholic drink) and vomiting.</strong>They washed Ribeiro's face 
                with pinga(alcholic drink), walking all night, almost all day without eating or drinking. It was after noon when we arrived 
                in Formoso at the pension in old Afonsa, where Nelson Marinho, Onezimo Montezuma and Aniceto Policarpo were already in prison,
                these they were all fellows of the association and of the party.<br>
                
                <br>They were all deformed by the tortures, in Nelson's house. They caught Nelson, they wanted him to tell where the leaders
                were and the weapons. They tied Nelson naked to a tree far from home on top of an anthill, they had beaten him a lot, they cut
                the scalp and made him swallow with police urine. We were joined by a student and a journalist, all injured.

            My father-in-law had a small farm there, and we saw that it was a strategic place, where in the begining we would have their 
            support and then the VAR would come to meet our needs so that we could do the political Work.<strong> That night, at home, they
            also arrested my father-in-law and mother-in-law, now elderly, and my father-in-law was handcuffed to a tree, my mother-in-law

            <br>There was no light on the farm, there wasn't even in the house, so they lit a bunch of lamps, candles, and one of the things
             they said, they even threatened to burn down the house with us inside. We were tortured at home, one in front of the other, they
             had a shock machine, which they called “maricota”, then they beat us with wet towels, had pliers, pinched us in the body, and my
             husband, they took him, threw him in the stream that was next to the house, they gave him electric shocks, inside the stream, he
             got traumas for the rest of his life, he had urinary problems, he had to treat his whole life. <br>
            
            
            <br>And then, the next day, we were boarded, me in an ambulance, my husband in an army truck, and they let us understand that they were
              going to take us to Curitiba, we left and no one knew our fait. But they brought us to the Frontier Battalion.<strong>Their pleasure
              was to torture each other and say "look, you bitch, he's getting beaten up because of you, because you don't want to cooperate", did 
              you understand? </strong>Or the other way around, understand? It was a game of psychological and physical torture, to really disrupt,
              destabilize us.
              I was very offended, as a woman, because being a woman and a militant is a karma, we, in addition to being tortured physically and
              psychologically, woman is a bitch, the word itself was "whore", "decent girl, look at your face, at that age, look what you're doing 
              here, that education your parents gave you, you're a bitch, you're no good", anyway, <strong>I don't remember well if on the third, 
              fourth day, I got in the process of miscarriage, I was two months pregnant, so I bled a lot, I had no way to protect myself, I used
              toilet paper, and it already had a bad smell, I was dirty.</strong>

            <br>
             And my husband would say, “please don't do anything to her, you can, you can torture me, but she's pregnant”, and they laughed, mocked,
             “this it's history, she's dirty, but it has nothing to do with it”, in short. At no point was this any kind of concern, regarding [pause,
             choked voice].I certainly miscarried because of the shocks I had in the first few days, in the genitals organs, in the breasts, in my 
             fingertips, behind the ears that obviously caused an imbalance, I remember that I had a lot, a lot, a lot of pain in the neck, because
             when we, who suffered shock, You know? We throw our heads back, then there was a moment when I didn't know where it hurt anymore, it

        I hope that my speech serves to show how tyranny pushed young people into underground activism. How organized state violence and public
        diffusion served to frighten our country. Tyranny had many faces, police, judiciary, TFR, university, journalistic, moral, cultural,

        for the friend I give one arm, for a woman a sweet hug, for the militia I bring damage, for the enemy another Bludger”. The persecution
        was followed by actions and labor rights, because I worked in the Araújo family's office. So, there was persecution because I participated
        in UNE, at PUC, participated in politics, in the academic directory of law.

            In the early 1970s, Carlos Zílio was arrested by the military regime and created this series of drawings while in prison. They were
            exposed to the public for the first time in 1996, <strong>late in May 1969, soldiers invaded the Museum of Modern Art (MAM) in Rio in 
            search of subversive elements. The target of the operation? The art. The military was sent to stop the VI Biennale of Youngen in Paris 
            exhibition, that was about to open its doors to the public.</strong><br>

             <br>The exhibition brought together works by Brazilian artists who had been selected for the Paris Biennale that year, such as the still young Antonio Manuel, who in the following years would experience a series of episodes of censorship.
             <strong>"It was an art exhibition, but the level of violence that was experienced was such that it was closed by machine-gun soldiers", recalls Manuel, now 71 years old. "My work was very marked by the repressive climate, of exception, in which we live. And the most aggressive, most violent period came with the AI-5."</strong>

             <br>The act suspended habeas corpus for political prisoners and institutionalized state repression and the practice of censorship, inaugurating the most violent period of the dictatorship - and imposing a strong rupture on Brazilian cultural production, in cinema, music, theater and in the visual arts.

        On a personal level, however, the repression made Cildo and other artists change their creative paths. he remembers how interrupted investigations he had been carrying out, which had a more formal focus, to carry out works of a strong political nature, such as Quem Matou Herzog? (1975)(Who killed Herzog?) and Tiradentes: Totem-monument to the Political Prisoner (1970). In this one, he burned live chickens hanging from a wooden totem on April 21, Tiradentes day, mocking the cult promoted by the military regime to the leader of the Inconfidência Mineira, executed by the State.                                                                         
        <br>
        
        <br><strong>"These were works resulting from indignation and seeing my personal project as an artist so invaded by circumstances",
        claims. "I had been dedicating myself to the Virtual Spaces and Virtual Volumes series, but I felt impelled to address these politics issues at work." "Censorship is a permanent obstruction of the mind," says Cildo. "You become a slave to an invisible wall."

            Compositor tells how “Cálice” emerged, which the dictatorship banned for five years in the 1970s São Paulo – One of the classic songs from the period of the dictatorship was born during a meeting during Holy Week in 1973, in Rio de Janeiro. It was the Friday of Passion, which that year it fell on April 20th. Chico Buarque received Gilberto Gil in his apartment, who had an idea in his head. The meeting from ideas, notes and lyrics, Chalice would emerge, whose lyrics seem to remain current. Just listen, for example, to the recent version of Renato raz, with Roberto Leão, Mario Gil and Breno Ruiz, with hints of Fado Tropical.
            Gil returned to talk about the origins of the song, writing on Twitter after Maria Bethânia's live, on Saturday (13) night. She sang Chalice, but the character generator showed only Chico Buarque as the author. Forbidden, the song was only released in 1978, recorded by Chico and Milton Nascimento.

            <br><strong>“I thought about taking a proposal and, the day before, I sat on the mat, where I was sleeping at the time, and started emptying the  circulating thoughts to concentrate,” said Gil. He recalled that, at the time, Chico lived in Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, which ended up entering the lyrics.</strong>

            <br><i>This silence all stuns me <br>
                Stunned I Remain Attentive <br>

            “As it was Passion Friday, the idea of Calvary and the cup of Christ seduced me, and I composed the chorus incorporating the Jesus' request in the moment of agony”, recalls Gil. “Next I wrote the first stanza, which I started remembering a bitter drink called Fernet, Italian, which Chico liked and which he offered me whenever I went to his house.”    
            </strong><br>

            <br><strong>So, the next day, Saturday, Chico offered it to Fernet and Gil showed what he had already done. “When, singing the chorus,
            I arrived at the 'cup'("cálice", in portuguese), he immediately realized the ambiguity that the word acquired, and associated it with 'shut up'("cale-se", in portuguese), introducing it into the song the sense of censorship", comments the composer from Bahia. "Afterwards, as I had only brought the melodized chorus we worked on the musicalization of the stanza based on ideas he presented. And we arranged a new meeting.”
            </strong>
            Gil made one more stanza and Chico another two. Four, all in eight decasyllables, recalls Gil.<strong>“Two or three days later we reviewed and defined the sequence. I thought we should intersperse our stanzas, because they don't presented a linear linkage to each other. He agreed, and the order was this: the first, mine, the second, his; The third, mine, and the last, his. In the third, the fourth verse and the two endings were influenced by Chico's idea of using the theme of silence.”</strong><br>

            <br>This theme had already appeared before, in the verse “Silêncio na Cidade não é listen”, written by Gil. "I mean: in the noise of the city, it is not possible to listen to the silence. That is to say: there is no point in wanting silence because there is no silence, that is: there is no censorship, the censorship is a chimera; moreover, 'even if your mouth is shut, the breast remains' and 'even if your breast is silent, your head remains': if you cut one thing, another appears.” Shortly thereafter, the authors performed at Phono 73, a collective concert held at Palácio das Convenções do Anhembi, in São Paulo. When trying to sing Chalice, the microphones were being turned off, it is not known whether by the censorship or by the organizers. I have the impression that it had been presented to the censors, having been recommended that we do not sing it, but we did a civil disobedience and we wanted to sing it”, says Gil.
